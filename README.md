# Intelligent-Text-Assistant-Using-Generative-AI
In this project, we'll create an intelligent text assistant using a Flask-based text editor application. Our aim is to leverage the Python library 'pyspellchecker' for text checking and Hugging Face models based on GPT-2 for advanced prediction functionality.

The goal is to develop a robust text assistant capable of predicting and completing text efficiently. By integrating Python libraries and Hugging Face models, we'll ensure a fast, powerful, and flexible implementation, providing users with a reliable and efficient text assistant experience.
